# My Portfolio

# About Me
I am Mary Joyce Mariano, currently immersed in my studies as a BSIT 2A student. Beyond the world of codes and algorithms, I find solace and excitement on the basketball court. It's more than just a hobby; it's where I channel my energy, challenge myself, and experience the thrill of teamwork and competition. From the squeak of sneakers to the satisfying swish of the net, basketball is an integral part of who I am.

# Reflection
# Challenges Faced and Solutions
While making my portfolio, I encountered some challenges that required patience and effort. One of the first challenges was deciding what work to include. At the start, I wanted to add everything, but I realized that too many items would make it confusing. I solved this by carefully selecting only the most relevant and strongest works, which helped make the portfolio clear and organized.

Another difficulty was designing the layout. Since I am not skilled in design, I struggled to arrange sections in a neat way. To fix this, I looked at examples of simple portfolios and followed their style. I focused on a clean and simple design so the portfolio would look professional without being overwhelming.

Time management was also a problem because creating a portfolio takes effort and attention. At first, I felt pressured, but I solved this by setting a schedule and completing one part at a time. This step-by-step approach made the work easier to handle.

Through these challenges, I learned how important it is to plan, organize, and stay patient. In the end, solving these problems allowed me to complete a portfolio I was proud of.

# Future Improvements
If I update my portfolio in the future, I would make several improvements to make it stronger. One thing I would focus on is adding more creativity. Right now, it is simple and neat, but adding visuals such as photos, graphics, or short clips could make it more attractive and engaging.

I would also work on keeping the portfolio updated. A portfolio should grow as I gain more skills and experiences, so I plan to include new projects and activities whenever possible. This will show progress and make the portfolio more complete.

Another improvement is design. I can study more about layouts, fonts, and colors to make the overall presentation better. Even small changes, like adjusting spacing or adding clear labels, can make it easier for others to read and understand.

Finally, I want to create an online version of my portfolio. A digital portfolio is easier to share and can reach more people. It also makes the work more accessible anytime.

In summary, I would improve my portfolio by making it creative, updated, well-designed, and available online. These changes would help it look more professional and effective.
